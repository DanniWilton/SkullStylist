Perth, Western Australia, August 16th 2021- A student from the University of Western Australia Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, released a website for local small business millinery company, Skull Stylist. Custom, bespoke and handmade millinery displayed on a slick and easy to use website. The owner of Skull Stylist, Fifi Fontaine, is able to log onto the website and upload and display their new work, as well as process sales, accept custom orders and update the shop. This takes out the need for third party applications like Etsy and Ebay, so there are no processing fees, Ms Fontaine is able to manage the website herself and finally use the ‘shop now’ function on the Skull Stylist instagram account. The Skull Stylist website upgrades this small local business along with reducing costs and making it easier to track custom design requests.
